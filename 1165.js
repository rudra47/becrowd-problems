// A Prime Number is a number that is divisible only by 1 (one) and by itself. For example the number 7 is Prime, because it can be divided only by 1 and by 7.

// Input
// The input contains several test cases. The first contains the number of test cases N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Each one of the following N lines contains an integer 
// X (1 < X ≤ 107), that can be or not a prime number.

// Output
// For each test case print the message “X eh primo” (X is prime) or “X nao eh primo” (X isn't prime) according with to above specification.
